```

### Ganache CLI (for non-public blockchain)
```
$ npm install -g ganache-cli
```

### Ethereum bridge (for non-public blockchain)
```
$ mkdir ethereum-bridge
$ git clone https://github.com/oraclize/ethereum-bridge ethereum-bridge
$ cd ethereum-bridge
$ npm install
```

```

If you using non-public blockchain, e.g. ganache-cli, you must add the following line in smart contract (MarketCoin.sol) constructor (when "0x..." is generated during startup ethereum-bridge. If youâ€™re using a different mnemonic than the standard Truffle one, the ETH address shown in between the round brackets will be different). Remove that line before production (like Ropsten testnet).

```
OAR = OraclizeAddrResolverI(0x...);
```

If you using non-public blockchain. At this point you should have open two terminal window with running:
  * ganache-cli
  * ethereum-bridge

Compile and migrate smart contracts:
```
$ truffle migrate --reset --network <type>
```

\<type>
  * development (non-public blockchain - ganache-cli)
  * ropsten (public blockchain testnet)
